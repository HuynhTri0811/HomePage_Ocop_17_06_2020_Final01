			Products
			--------
			Each item on the product board is identified by the 'product' class.
			There are two size variations, identified by the classes 'medium' or 'large'.
			
			Details expansion:
			The details expansion is operated by an id. 
			The 'details-extra' div has an id, eg: 'details-0001'
			This is paired with the anchor tag with class 'details-expand' which has a matching data-target of that id.
